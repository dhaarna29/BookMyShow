//
// Program Name: Chatterbot10
// Description: The purpose of Chatterbot10 is to introduce the concept of 'keyword location'
// Some keywords can be found alone within a sentence, some others can't because the sentence
// wouldn't have any meaning. Ex: the keyword (THIS IS) can not be found alone within a given
// sentence because there is no proper meaning to it.
